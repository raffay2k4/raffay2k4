# About me
Hi, my name is Abdul Raffay Naeem. I am a Final Year Computer Science student with a passion for Data Science and AI. I enjoy making data spill its secrets and teaching AI to think smarter.

I am proficient in tools such as Microsoft Excel and Power BI, through which I have created many insightful and visually appealing dashboards. I have developed strong expertise in SQL, mastering fundamentals such as joins, CTEs, window functions, and group by operations to efficiently manipulate data.

I have a strong foundation in Machine Learning and AI, with expertise in building predictive models using scikit-learn. My experience extends to working with neural networks, utilizing PyTorch and TensorFlow to develop and optimize complex models. My enthusiasm for computer vision has led me to gain proficiency in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and YOLO, where I have honed my skills in model fine-tuning and advanced image analysis techniques.

I also specialize in AI chatbot development, leveraging LangChain and LangGraph to build advanced conversational AI systems with seamless external data integration. My expertise in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ensures highly contextual responses, while Chainlit enables the creation of chat interfaces.

Additionally, I use FastAPI to deploy and scale AI models through robust API endpoints.

__atomcamp__ | Data Science and AI Bootcamp | June 2024-Nov 2024
                                                               Over 6 months, I built a strong foundation in Data Science and AI. I started with Excel, learning data scraping, cleaning, and exploratory analysis, and then advanced to Power BI, focusing on data transformation, modeling, and visualization. My SQL skills expanded from basic queries to advanced joins and window functions. In Python, I mastered essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, with a focus on data analysis and visualization. I delved into advanced EDA, tackling data preprocessing and feature engineering, and applied machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means Clustering to real world problems. Building on this, I explored Natural Language Processing (NLP), gaining expertise in libraries like NLTK, worked with large language models (LLMs), and integrated them using LangChain. Additionally, I created endpoints using FastAPI to support AI driven solutions.
