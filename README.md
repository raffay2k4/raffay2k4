# About me
Hi, my name is Abdul Raffay Naeem. I am a motivated 3rd-year Computer Science student with a passion for Data Science and AI. I enjoy making data spill its secrets and teaching AI to think smarter.

I am proficient in tools such as Microsoft Excel and Power BI, through which I have created many insightful and visually appealing dashboards. I have developed strong expertise in SQL, mastering fundamentals such as joins, CTEs, window functions, and group by operations to efficiently manipulate data.

I have a strong foundation in Machine Learning and AI, with expertise in building predictive models using scikit-learn. My experience extends to working with neural networks, utilizing PyTorch and TensorFlow to develop and optimize complex models. My enthusiasm for computer vision has led me to gain proficiency in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and YOLO, where I have honed my skills in model fine-tuning and advanced image analysis techniques.

I am also eager to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to further enhance my capabilities in these exciting areas.
